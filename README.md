Nolij Website Backup Script Readme
==================================

The Nolij Website Backup script was created to act as a generic backup script for all of 
Nolij's website projects. This script creates compressed tar archives of website
directories and uploads those directories to AWS S3 buckets.

Additionally, the script can be invoked to backup associated MySQL databases and to send
notification emails.
